    "share some properties:\n",
    "- They consist of multiple items which are ordered. (That does not mean they are sorted e.g. by size! It simply means, there is a first item, a second item, etc.)\n",
    "- To access a specific item of the sequence, an index can be used.\n",

    "You already know strings, too. A string also is a sequence data type. It is used exclusively for text and can contain\n",
